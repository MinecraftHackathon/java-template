# Hackathon

## How to use

You need to use one of the branch `spigot`, `forge` or `fabric` and set it as your main branch. Then you can start to code your mod or plugin.

## Documentation

You have for each branch a link to their documentation. But here a resume:

Forge: (Mod)
- Official documentation: https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/1.19.2/gettingstarted/
- French tutorials: https://www.minecraftforgefrance.fr/topic/12/sommaire-des-tutoriels
- KubeJS Mod (to write JS code): https://kubejs.com/, https://mods.latvian.dev/books/kubejs

Fabric: (Mod) (I don't recommend it)
- Official documentation: https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:introduction

Spigot: (Plugin)

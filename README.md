# Fabric

(I don't recommend using Fabric)

## Development

Please use Intellij Idea to develop your mod or plugin. You can download it here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download <br>
You have a Minecraft Development plugin for Intellij Idea. You can download it here: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327-minecraft-development (or search it on the plugins page of Intellij Idea)

> **Warning**
> Don't ask me how to use VsCode, I don't know ðŸ¤£

## Documentation

The documentation is available at https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:introduction

## Running

Use the configurations from Intellij or run `./gradlew runClient` or `./gradlew runServer` to run the game.

## Tools

If you want to do some modeling you can use [BlockBench](https://www.blockbench.net/downloads).  <br>
You can use [GeckoLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib) to animate models

> **Warning**
> Check what type of model to use before starting ! <br>
> Mod can use Minecraft JSON or OBJ model (Idk for Fabric)

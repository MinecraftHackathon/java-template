# Hackathon

## How to use

You need to use one of the branch `spigot`, `forge` or `fabric` and set it as your main branch. Then you can start to code your mod or plugin.

## Development

Please use Intellij Idea to develop your mod or plugin. You can download it here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download <br>
You have a Minecraft Development plugin for Intellij Idea. You can download it here: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327-minecraft-development (or search it on the plugins page of Intellij Idea)

> **Warning**
> Don't ask me how to use VsCode, I don't know ðŸ¤£
